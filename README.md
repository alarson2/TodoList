# TodoList
Simple Todo List project based on Tyler Potts' design

I followed an online tutorial and tweaked a couple things in the UI, but this was made to practice my design skills and to expand my JavaScript/JSON knowledge.
This simple application saves the user's name and tasks in local storage for reusability.
